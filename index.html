      </li>
      <div id="intro-2" class="collapse sub-content">
        <p>We are so excited that you have taken the next step in your career and joined us! Over the next 20 weeks here at Prime Academy, you will have a lot to do. Before you are on campus, you will need to complete all of the Pre-Work content. In an effort to organize all of the to-do’s, we have built this site to keep you informed about what you need to complete each week.</p>
        <p>To be clear, Pre-Work has many important steps to complete and in order to transition into the classroom phase, you will need to complete each of those steps.</p>
        <p>The first week will be all about settling into the Pre-Work phase of the program. It will be a time for you to get everything setup and understand how to work all the different systems of communication we use. These systems and their use are vitally important to being effective not only during Pre-Work, but also be set up to be effective in the classroom. I wanted to call out the first week specifically, as it is a little different than the rest. In general, expect to allocate 10-15 hours each week during pre-study.</p>
        <p>Weeks 2 through 6 of Pre-Study will have CodeAcademy.com content associated with it. We will instruct you which units you will need to complete each week. You may work ahead, but know that the focus of the week will be on the assigned content. We will discuss our educational methodology at length as we get deeper in the program, but the important thing to know now, is that we ask that you complete what we ask first, both CodeAcademy content and assignments, before working ahead. CodeAcademy does a decent job at introducing you to content, but retention will come from practicing the concepts in the assignments and discussing the topics on Slack with your Peers and Instruction team.</p>
        <p>To that end, each week will have not only assignments created by Prime to help you retain what you learned on CodeAcademy, but also discussion questions to be answered on Slack. Finally, we will have Live Chats each week to give you a chance to hear from your instructors. They cover a range of topics, including shoring up FAQs, letting you know what’s going on at Prime, and covering extremely relevant non-development topics. Of the six weeks of Pre-Work, two of those weeks will have on-site Live Chats hosted at Prime. Those will be called out in the week sections. It will give you a chance to meet your peers and Instructor(s) in person as well as see the space in which you will be learning. Do you absolute best to make sure that you make the On-Site Live Chats. </p>
        <p></p>

        <p>I really want to emphasize a couple things going into the Pre-Study phase:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This content is new to you. It may seem easy at times. At other times, it will feel like you are under water. One thing I want you to keep in mind, is that you are not the first person to feel this at Prime. This is part of the learning process, especially with learning Development. Everyone single person at Prime has gone through this. Even those who work at Prime. We will work on getting you comfortable with identifying when you are at different points, but go into Pre-Work knowing that the more you communicate your abilities and deficiencies, throughout the whole program, the stronger you will leave this program.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Completing all the work assigned it key to your success. It may sound obvious, but you need to complete all work to finish the program. The work needs to be authentically yours, meaning that plagiarism is not tolerated. Once again, that may sound obvious, but handing in code that was written by others does not teach you anything. We designed the curriculum and its work to stretch you. Resetting your career is no small thing and it will ask more of you than what you may have historically been able to give. But know that we put a lot of work into the application process and we believe that you are capable of navigating this program. As always, communicate with us when things are difficult. We want to help, it’s why we are here.</li>
          <br />
          <li>It is EXTREMELY difficult to catch up in this program. We know that life comes up. With that said, make sure to make all parts of Prime a priority. One mistake we have seen learners make in the past, is that they believe that things will get better once they get in the classroom. That if they simply skim the Pre-Work content, things will be OK. This is a strategy that has historically not worked for students. Do you best each week during Pre-Work to have scheduled time to work on the content for that week. Earlier in the week of course will allow you some time to ask questions and get answers. With all of that said, as mentioned above, life comes up. We are always here to help, but we need to know about delays and questions as soon as possible so that we have time to get you caught up as quickly as possible.</li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <p>Just to reiterate again, we are here for you. We expect there to be questions. We know that you are going to have a blast here, we know that things are going to be frustrating at times, intensely rewarding at others. We know that you are going to be challenged, have glorious ‘ah-ha!’ moments, and that experience just about every other emotion in between. Know that we are looking forward to helping you during this next phase of your life and we are dedicated to your success.</p>

        <p>Below are some materials to check out if you are ready and itching to dig in! You can come back to this content at any time if you are wanting to take on a little week. Strengthening yourself by reinforcing your studies or reviewing what you’ve learned in these areas will help you long term! In addition to free materials, we’ve included some paid resources on this list. They are not required by Prime but we think some of you may want to invest in them on your own.</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <p>You have probably heard of Javascript before, and now would be a good time to dive head first into it. Speaking from experience, the sooner you expose yourself to the concepts, the more you will be set up for success as we delve into some of the deeper, more challenging concepts.</p>

    <h2>Week 1 - Command Line, Git, and GitHub</h2>
    <p>Week 1 is all about getting familiar with core technology that we will be using throughout the program. We will check out Command Line, Git, GitHub, and the Prime Academy Assignment Application. We understand the appearance and ‘feel’ of the Command Line (Terminal), Git, and GitHub can be a bit intimidating. Leap into the content and we think you will find our introduction approachable. Make sure to complete each of the steps listed below.</p>

        <p>“How would you explain Git and Github to your Grandparents?"</p>

      <h2>Week 2 - Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
      <p>This week we will introduce the programming language of the Internet, Javascript. With Javascript we can make our websites 'smart' by adding interactivity and logic. Pay special attention this week to understanding the concepts that are introduced. They are foundational in the weeks to come and we’ll be referencing them often as we move forward.</p>

          <p>Welcome to Javascript! The courses that follow on Javascript are incredibly important. Javascript is the teaching language for our program at Prime. From the front-end development we do to manage user interactions, to interfacing with MongoDB to strore and retrieve information, Javascript is there. We understand that this is (may be) your first pass at learning Javascript. It is going to take time to absorb. You will run through it once here in pre-work, but then we discuss and reinforce it during the first week of in-class.</p>
          <p>Take your time with the content. Write down the questions you have. Ask each other, bring them to the Live Chats. Email them to me or post them on Slack!</p>

          <p>Note that the unit names are 'Introduction to Javascript' and 'Functions'</p>
          <p>You will also see that there are 'Interactive Lesson' sections on Code Academy for these units. You are certainly welcome to complete those sections, however we do consider them to be 'additional learning' for you. We felt strongly that those alone were not enough to really get a solid grasp on the content, which is why we created additional assignments to challenge and solidify your understanding of the content covered this week.</p>
