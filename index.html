        <h2>Week 1 - Front End</h2>
        <p>In week 1 we will dive deeper into HTML, beyond the basics that you covered in the training you did as part of your application to Prime. If you would like to shore up your understanding of HTML basics before starting this week, check out Code Schools’ Front-end Foundations. This course is a great opportunity to get familiar with Code School's interface and test what you learned from Code Academy.</p>

        <h2>Week 2 - Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This week we will introduce the programming language of the Internet, Javascript. With Javascript we can make our websites 'smart' by adding interactivity and logic. Pay special attention this week to understanding the concepts that are introduced. They are foundational in the weeks to come and we’ll be referencing them often as we move forward.</p>

        <h2>Week 3 - Version Control</h2>
        <p>You might recognize GIT from working with GitHub during your Prime application. GIT is a popular 'version control' software that allows storage, history, and collaboration between developers. It allows us to have confidence when working together on a project, and this week is all about being introduced to it. Certainly a change of pace from the topics that we have covered previously, so be ready to feel the pivot from what we have previously discussed.</p>

        <h2>Week 4 - Intermediate JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Concepts introduced this week will be more challenging than in previous weeks Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to study and absorb. Questions will come up, make sure that you are jotting them down and asking them in live chat, via email or in the discussion forum. Understand that what you don't understand might be something others do not understand - asking a question can help you and your classmates learn. Take the time to communicate with each other. One of the main focuses this week is all about understanding your support systems and learning from each other.</p>

        <h2>Week 5 - Wrapping up JavaScript</h2>
        <p>It's time to wrap up our study of Javascript. This will be another week that might feel 'heavy' in content, so plan accordingly. Continue to utilize your support systems. If you understand the content well, know that teaching can help you understand the topics better. Pay attention to how your peers are feeling and see if you can reach out and help each other with difficult topics.</p>

        <h2>Week 6 - Libraries and Styling</h2>
        <p>This week is a little bit of 'odds and ends' in some very powerful content. With jQuery, you will start to learn about getting things functional, fast. With the CSS course, you will learn some 'pro tips' on getting your work to really pop. This week will take some time to get through, but is much easier content to consume than the previous week.</p>

            <h3>Strengthsfinder Assessment</h3>
            <p>We'll email you an access code and a link to take a Strengthsfinder quiz this week. Strengthsfinder is an assessment to help you identify which abilities you lead with as your personal strengths. The quiz generates a personalized insights report and an Action-Planning Guide. Completing the quiz and reading the results should take about 30 minutes. We're introducing you to Strenghtsfinder to accomplish two goals. First, it's a good way to self-reflect on your own work style, learn about your fellow students, and understand howothers prefer to tackle challenges within group environments. Second, it's an assessment that's widely used within hiring partner organizations, so being able to speak confidently to your Strengths results may help you within future job interviews.</p>
