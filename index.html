        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Prime! Before our first week, please be sure to watch and review the content listed below so you're ready for Week 1.</p>

                All <div>'s used to be inside <li>'s but removed them
                because each panel was closing when students tried to click links
                inside the panel. I indented each of the <div>'s but technically they
                are on the same level as the previous <li>'s. This needs to be restructured.

                <div id="intro-2" class="collapse sub-content">
                    <p>Each week, you will see a list of CodeSchool content to complete. Once you have finished the activities for the week, head over to the discussion thread.</p>
                    <p>There you will be posed a question that ties into the content you just finished reviewing. Share your thoughts on the topic, and check out your peers' responses and engage in additional conversation!</p>
                    <p>After the discussion, it’s time for the assessment. One important thing I want you to keep in mind throughout prework, 'WE WILL BE REVIEWING THIS CONTENT IN CLASS THE FIRST WEEK". The reason I emphasize this is that I want to make sure you all know that there is time to absorb this information. While I want you be learning the content, I also understand that it may take some time to do so. So if you are feeling stressed out that you aren’t grasping the concepts  from CodeSchool, don't stress out. Reach out to me, your Instructor, reach out to your fellow students and give yourself time to review the content a second or third time.</p>
                    <p>"Its together that you will succeed in Prime."</p>
                    <p>This is a team based learning environment. We selected each of you because we feel you have something to bring to the group as a whole. I want you to engage with each other and with me.</p>
                    <p>Finally, toward the end week, we will be have two, one hour Live discussion sessions. You only need to attend one. We do know however, that even offering two different times, that there may be some people who cannot attend in a given week. If this happens, please get in contact with me as soon as possible so we can ensure you don’t fall behind.</p>
                    <p>The hangouts are a  chance for us all to chat about what we are learning that week, and for you to bring any questions that you may have. We will be have those discussions through Google Hangouts and the links will be provided at the 'attend an event' step for each week. Make sure that you have a Gmail account that you are willing to use for school and the Google Hangout plug-in installed. It is a Video Style chat, and you are welcomed to use your camera, but do not feel as though its a requirement. I would like you to have a Microphone however. This is so you can interact with all of us. If neither of those are possible, just let me know that is the case through an email prior to the discussions.</p>
                    <p>To recap:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weeks are Monday morning to Sunday night. To be clear, Monday is when I will be going into the Pathwright backend and checking scores on assessments, or pulling GitHub Pages to see what work you have completed for the prior week. Then touching base with you if I see that I can help. Assessments need not be completed prior to the Live Chats, in fact I encourage to bring whatever questions you have to them.</li>
                        <li>Complete the 'Code School' course(s) for each week.</li>
                        <li>Participate in the Discussion on the 'Discussion Step'. Start by answering the weekly question, continue by interacting with your peers on their answers.</li>
                        <li>Take the Assessment each week.</li>
                        <li>Come hang out for an hour during one of the two live chats.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div id="intro-3" class="collapse sub-content">
                    <p>Below are some materials to check out if you are ready and itching to dig in! Keep in mind that you can come back to this content at any time if you are wanting to take on a little more in any given  week. Strengthening yourself by reinforcing your studies or reviewing what you’ve learned in these areas will help you long term! In addition to free materials, we’ve included some paid resources on this list. They are not required by Prime but we think some of you may want to invest in them on your own.</p>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You have probably heard of Javascript before, and now would be a good time to dive head first into it. Speaking from experience, the sooner you expose yourself to the concepts, the more you will be set up for success as we delve into some of the deeper, more challenging concepts.</p>

                    <p>Optional Additional Materials :</p>

                    </ul>

                    <p>jQuery will be your first brush into the world of code libraries. At its core, jQuery is actually just Javascript, but with pre-programmed functionality to accelerate the development of some common tasks. If that does not make a ton of sense now, don't stress. As you tackle more projects at Prime, you will learn to love the concepts of code libraries and realize how valuable they are!</p>

        <h2>Week 1 - Front End</h2>
        <p>In week 1 we will dive deeper into HTML, beyond the basics that you covered in the training you did as part of your application to Prime. If you would like to shore up your understanding of HTML basics before starting this week, check out Code Schools’ Front-end Foundations. This course is a great opportunity to get familiar with Code School's interface and test what you learned from Code Academy.</p>

                <p>Head over to: Code School - Front End Foundations

                    Complete the course.

                    "This is an excellent course for a refresher on HTML and CSS . We have heard from previous students that this course was foundational in re-establishing some of the concepts from the resume challenge. While some of it might seem redundant from the resume challenge learnings, I promise you that you will appreciate the refresher." -Joseph

                    Check out the Chapter list below to get an idea of what is covered:

                    HTML
                    CSS
                    Classes and Layouts
                    Images
                    Fonts and Forms</p>
            </div>

                    <p>Complete the course.

                        "This course tackles the HTML5 specification (and talks about what that means!) and touches briefly on some techniques used in CSS3. Both of these are the most current versions of their respective technology and represent the current state of the art on the web.

                        First, you will expand your knowledge of some new tags available to you in HTML5. With a cool emphasis on 'Forms' and their capabilities. This may be your first run in with Forms and they may be a little confusing at first. Keep in mind that I want you all to absorb the information that is being presented to you, but memorization is not a requirement. We are going to be covering this material over and over throughout the program. Adding complexity while reinforcing our understanding of the basics. So don't stress out or beat yourself up if you are struggling. Its OK, if this 'stuff' was easy, everyone would do it.

                        After exploring HTML5, you will tackle some popular CSS3 techniques. This will give you a chance to look into some awesome styling capabilities and hopefully open you up to the idea of beautiful 'front-end design'." </p>

                    <p>RESUME RE-CHALLENGE

                        So you knocked out the Code School course. Awesome! Now lets take another crack at that resume employing the skills you just learned. Additionally, so much of what is important in software development, is understanding what the code is doing and speaking to the decisions that you made in your code. So after you overhaul your resume challenge a bit, I want you to do a small write up on what you changed and why.

                        What to do:

                        Enhance your resume with however you see fit based off what you learned this week. Keep a log of changes that you made that will help support your written portion of this assignment.
                        Recommit your work to GitHub Pages so that I can review what you have completed.
                        Email me what you changed about your resume styling and presentation, make sure to give it the subject "RESUME CHALLENGE - <<your name>>". In talking about what you changed, make sure to talk about what things might have been 'new learnings' for you and why you decided to integrate them into your existing resume.</p>

                    <div id="w1-bonus" class="collapse sub-content">
                        <p>Divs are awesome. We use them a ton once we get into adding functionality to our web experiences. But some developers use them excessively. Your task is to replace every Div you have in your resume with any of the new tags you learned about.

                            NOTE: There might be reasons why you can't eliminate all of them, the goal here is to think critically about what NEEDS to be a Div, versus what can be something else.

                            Once you are complete, post your work to GitHub Pages.</p>

        <h2>Week 2 - Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This week we will introduce the programming language of the Internet, Javascript. With Javascript we can make our websites 'smart' by adding interactivity and logic. Pay special attention this week to understanding the concepts that are introduced. They are foundational in the weeks to come and we’ll be referencing them often as we move forward.</p>

                        "Welcome to Javascript! The courses that follow on Javascript are incredibly important. Javascript is the teaching language for our program at Prime. From the front-end development we do to manage user interactions, to interfacing with MongoDB to strore and retrieve information, Javascript is there. I understand that this is (may be) your first pass at learning Javascript. It is going to take time to absorb. You will run through it once here in pre-work, but then we discuss and reinforce it during the first week of in-class.

                        Take your time with the content. Write down the questions you have. Ask each other, bring them to the Live Chats. Email them to me! "</p>

                        "Welcome to the exciting world of Functions! Things are starting to get a little more complex. If you are feeling overwhelmed as you go through this course, know it is completely normal. If you are feeling in over your head, know it is completely normal. If you get frustrated a bit, know it’s completely normal. Programming isn’t about getting it right on the first try, its about failing repeatedly and learning from your mistakes.

                        As always, write down your  questions. Keep moving through the content if you are stumped. Take a couple passes through the content. When I was learning how to code, I literally wrote every single thing I was learning down on paper. It forced me to think more about what was going on in the code, and everything that was needed in the syntax." </p>

        <h2>Week 3 - Version Control</h2>
        <p>You might recognize GIT from working with GitHub during your Prime application. GIT is a popular 'version control' software that allows storage, history, and collaboration between developers. It allows us to have confidence when working together on a project, and this week is all about being introduced to it. Certainly a change of pace from the topics that we have covered previously, so be ready to feel the pivot from what we have previously discussed.</p>

                        "Welcome back to Git! You had your first brush with Git when submitting your technical challenge (the resume challenge) to GitHub. However, note that this is Git and not GitHub. GitHub uses Git, which is a version control system. This course is very light touch. It introduces you to the concepts of version control and the approach my be slightly jarring.

                        Unlike the last courses you took, Try Git puts you into an editor fairly quickly without a ton of context as to what is going on. Hang in there and go through the courses motions. It takes roughly 15 minutes to complete this course, but it serves as a nice warm up to Git Real, which is the next course."</p>

                        "Now we dive deeper. Much deeper into the world of Git. Note that we are using your Mac's 'Terminal' to use Git, which is what the interface Code School is emulating. We purposefully saved this course for last, as it might seem the most vague and context-less. What I really want you to take away from this course, is 'conceptually' what is happening at each of the different commands.

                        As always, we will reinforce these topics in the first week of in class. You will get PLENTY of Terminal level Git practice. You will get the hang of this as we practice it over and over in class, where it will be rich with practical context. But in order to get you to that point, I want the basic concepts to be introduced here, so we can later reinforce them."</p>

                    <p>The Function Challenge + Git

                        For this assignment, you will need to create an HTML / CSS / and Javascript files. The HTML only need to have a header that reads "Function Challenge" with just a little styling in the CSS. Then, create a function in the Javascript that console logs out "Hey this works!". Then you will need to check in the project into a personal GitHub repo (Note: NOT GitHub pages). Make sure to name the Repo "prime_prestudy_01".

                        The goal of this assignment is to prove that you have a handle on how all of the pages 'link' together and that you can get a project posted to GitHub.</p>

                        <p>Ok, console logs are great, but lets actually make functions that do things. Create three functions, each taking in a single number. Then do something to that number and return a new number. Then call each of those functions in one giant chain.

                            Example:

                            functionA(functionB(functionC( 2 ) ) ) ;

                            Assuming that you set this up correctly, you should get a numerical return that is a combination of all the functions running, taking in a function in the place of a number. EVEN IF YOU GET THIS WORKING AND ARE UNSURE OF 'WHY' IT WORKS, thats OK. This is just showing you that you can use functions in place of many things. We will deep dive these concepts in class!

                            Once you are complete, check it into a repo titled "prime_prestudy_bonus_week_03"</p>

        <h2>Week 4 - Intermediate JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Concepts introduced this week will be more challenging than in previous weeks Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to study and absorb. Questions will come up, make sure that you are jotting them down and asking them in live chat, via email or in the discussion forum. Understand that what you don't understand might be something others do not understand - asking a question can help you and your classmates learn. Take the time to communicate with each other. One of the main focuses this week is all about understanding your support systems and learning from each other.</p>

                        "The complexity is building. Having a solid base from the concepts last week will help you keep your head above water this week. At any point, don’t hesitate to go back and review the content from the week before. Prime is all about going back and strengthening foundations as we move into more difficult content. Each part of the program builds on the last - you’ll see this once you enter the classroom. Going back and reviewing earlier content  doesn’t mean you’re 'not ready', its exactly what you should be doing. You’re learning a lot and it is natural to sometimes feel like things are 'out of control' when you’re learning to code.

                        Stick with the content.

                        Review where necessary.

                        Ask questions.

                        Breathe your frustration out, then get back in it.

Take the time and work through this course slowly and understand what each of the tools does.

They allow you to debug the problems you are encountering and rapidly experiment with different solutions."

        <h2>Week 6 - Libraries and Styling</h2>
        <p>This week is a little bit of 'odds and ends' in some very powerful content. With jQuery, you will start to learn about getting things functional, fast. With the CSS course, you will learn some 'pro tips' on getting your work to really pop. This week will take some time to get through, but is much easier content to consume than the previous week.</p>

                    <p>Lets take one more crack at that Resume. This time, hide the entire resume. Then, using a button, reveal the resume using jQuery. Additionally, push the styling of the resume with all the new crazy CSS you just learned!</p>
                    <p>This time, instead of checking it into GitHub pages, lets check it into a new repo called "prime_prestudy_03_resume".</p>

            <h3>Strengthsfinder Assessment</h3>
            <p>We'll email you an access code and a link to take a Strengthsfinder quiz this week. Strengthsfinder is an assessment to help you identify which abilities you lead with as your personal strengths. The quiz generates a personalized insights report and an Action-Planning Guide. Completing the quiz and reading the results should take about 30 minutes. We're introducing you to Strenghtsfinder to accomplish two goals. First, it's a good way to self-reflect on your own work style, learn about your fellow students, and understand howothers prefer to tackle challenges within group environments. Second, it's an assessment that's widely used within hiring partner organizations, so being able to speak confidently to your Strengths results may help you within future job interviews.</p>

                        <p>You may have taken Strengsthfinder before in a prior workplace.

                            Around the beginning of Week 6, you will receive an email with information on how to take the Strengthfinder.

                            Please take the test again if you have taken it before, as your top five strengths may have shifted over time. It is important that you answer the questions as truthfully as possible to derive the most value from the exercise.

                            Finally, we'll use your Strengthsfinder results in a Classroom activity next week, so print out your Top Five results and bring it with you on the first day of class!</p>
