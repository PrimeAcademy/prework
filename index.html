        <h2>Week 1 - Front End</h2>
        <p>In week 1 we will dive deeper into HTML, beyond the basics that you covered in the training you did as part of your application to Prime. If you would like to shore up your understanding of HTML basics before starting this week, check out Code Schools’ Front-end Foundations. This course is a great opportunity to get familiar with Code School's interface and test what you learned from Code Academy.</p>

        <h2>Week 2 - Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This week we will introduce the programming language of the Internet, Javascript. With Javascript we can make our websites 'smart' by adding interactivity and logic. Pay special attention this week to understanding the concepts that are introduced. They are foundational in the weeks to come and we’ll be referencing them often as we move forward.</p>
